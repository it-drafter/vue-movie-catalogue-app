# Vue Movie Catalogue App

This is a basic movie catalogue app built with Vue.

In this mini-project, I used:
- Composition API
- ref, onMounted
- v-bind, v-if, v-for
- input field validation written in JavaScript
- JavaScript built-in 'fetch API' with 'async/await' notation and 'try/catch' error handling - in order to work with GET, POST and DELETE requests,
- Firebase Realtime Database to store the data
- some Bootstrap styling
